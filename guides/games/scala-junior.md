# Scala Junior

_A simplified variation of the classic card game Scala 40, designed for younger players._

---

## Introduction

Scala 40 is a staple of Italian culture. It's a card game often played during family gatherings, and for many young children, a rite of passage of sorts. When kids learn how to play, they are allowed to play with the adults, taking part in this tradition alongside their parents and grandparents. This simplified variation, Scala Junior, is designed for younger players who may not yet be ready for the full ruleset.

## Objective

The goal is simple: be the first player to get rid of all your cards.

---

## Materials

- Standard deck of 52 cards (you'll remove some in Setup).
- 2 or more players

---

## Setup

Remove the jokers and all picture cards, leaving 40 cards (this makes it easy for younger players to handle the deck).
Deal the cards, 7 per player. After dealing the last card, turn the next one face up, and put it down next to the rest of the deck. Choose the first player (usually the youngest).

## Rules

### Your Turn

When it's your turn, you must always draw a card. This can either be the one on top of the discard pile (face up) or the first of the deck (face down).

Now, you must arrange your cards to form sets or runs – each containing at least two cards.

A **Set** contains 2 or more cards that have the same **value**
_the 4♥︎ and the 4♣︎_

A **Run** contains 2 or more consecutive cards of the **same suit**
_the 2♥ and 3♥_

When you have a set or a run, you may place the cards face up in the middle of the table. You may place more than one set or run in a single turn.

If you have a card that can be **added** to a set or run on the table, you may do that.
_If there is a set containing the 2♥︎ and the 3♥︎ and you have the 4♥︎, you may attach it_

At the end of your turn, you always discard one card (face up on the discard pile)

_If you cannot discard a card at the end of your turn, you must take back one of the cards from a set or run you placed on the table (of your choice), returning it to your hand. The remaining cards from that set or run stay on the table._

### Winning the Game

If you discard your last card, you win the game!

## Progressive Complexity

As the players become more comfortable with these basic rules, you can gradually introduce more rules from the traditional game.

This might mean adding back the picture cards, raising the minimum number of cards required for sets or runs, or introducing point requirements for opening. Adjust the pace of these changes to suit the players’ age and experience, keeping the focus on fun and accessibility.
